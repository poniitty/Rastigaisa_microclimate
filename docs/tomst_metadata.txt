T1	# Soil temperature (°C, -7.5 cm) from Tomst TMS-4 logger	

T2	# Surface temperature (°C, 0 cm) from Tomst TMS-4 logger. Be carefull about vegetation/water/litter effect on these!!!

site	# Study site code

probl		# Error code for Tomst logger measurements: 
		# 0 = ok
		# 1 = Clearly errorneous data (e.g., logger fallen and off the ground)
		# 3 = T3 without solar shielding but data may be useful for some purposes, T1 & T2 ok.
		# 4 = T2 and moist ok, T1 and T3 problematic

# Logger data was not filtered in any way prior the calculations (only at-office data removed). 
# Therefore think carefully which sites can be included in analyses.
